A multi-monitor, multi-media, multi-sensory application

I have a multi-monitor setup at home and created a hacked together piece of software to play media while I code, play games or just in the background.  This is a replacement for that software, but much more.  It will connect to addressable LEDs to affect them based on situations within the application.

LEDs: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CDTECSG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Arduino Uno: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GRTSV6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Power for the Arduino, also important for the LEDs:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y1LF8T5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Specification details to come.
